# Huffman coding

In this assignment you will implement the Huffman coding. This is a very elegant 
and simple but powerful compression algorithm. The idea is to generate a binary sequence that represents each character 
required. This might be the English alphabet, some subset of that, or any 
collection of symbols. 

Say we have a 100KB file made up of repetitions of the letters 'a' to 'f'.
We start by creating a frequency table:

![Frequency table](etc/images/ftable.png)

If we use a fixed-length code we can encode this data in about
37.5KB. If we use a variable-length code and assign the shortest
code to the most frequently used characters, we can encode it in
just 28KB. (Note that in the table below the code for each character is made up of the *bits* 1 and 0, not made 
the *characters*, each of which occupies at least 8 bits depending on the encoding.)

It should be clear that in order to decode a stream of variable-length codes, no code should be a prefix of any other. 
We can create the variable-length codes using a binary tree (not
a search tree) called a *Huffman tree*. In a Huffman tree the leaves contain the data, which is a
character and its frequency. Internal nodes are labelled with the
combined frequencies of their children.

To decode data we go start at the root and go left for 0, and right
for 1 until we get to a leaf. So, to decode `0101100`, we start at the root and
after consuming a single digit from the code, `0`, we reach a leaf labelled `a`. We return 
to the root and take digits from the code until we reach another leaf, which is labelled `b`,
and so on, eventually decoding the whole string `abc`.

The most elegant part of this scheme is the algorithm used to create the tree:

1. Use the frequency table to make a leaf node object for each character, including a label
for its frequency.
2. Put these nodes in a *priority queue*, where the lowest
frequency has highest priority.
3. Repeatedly:
    - Remove two nodes from the queue and insert them as children
to a new branch node. The new node is labelled by the sum of the frequency labels of its children.
    - Put the new node back in the queue.
    - When there is only one item in the queue, that's the Huffman
tree.

## Problems

1. First, implement the *priority queue* in the class `PQueue`. The data in the queue is stored in an `ArrayList`. The 
`enqueue` method adds a node to the queue. The new node should be inserted at the point where the frequency of next node is
 greater than or equal to that of the new one. So work out where that is, then use the `add` method of the `ArrayList` class, 
 which takes a position at which to add the new object. The `dequeue` method simply removes the first node from the queue,
 for which you can use the `get` method of `ArrayList`. The `size` method returns
 the size of the queue.
 
 2. Implement the `freqTable` method in `Huffman`. If the input to this method is `null`, return `null` straight away.
 Otherwise, create a new `map` like so:
 
    ```
    Map<Character, Integer> ft = new HashMap<>();
    ``` 
    
    This is a map from characters to integers, representing the frequency of each character in the input string. 
    Loop through the input string. For each character, if it is already in the map update its entry in the map by 
    adding one to it. If this character is not in the map, add a new entry for it with the count set to 1. Some 
    methods from `Map` you will find useful are `containsKey`, `get` and `put`.
    
    At this point, you should be able to make one of the tests pass.
    
 3. Implement the `treeFromFreqTable` method, which constructs a Huffman tree from a frequency table. First, create an 
 empty priority queue. Then make a leaf node for every entry in the frequency table and add it to the queue. Next, take 
 the first two nodes from the queue and combine them in a branch node that is labelled by the combined frequency of the 
 nodes and put it back in the queue. Do this repeatedly until there is a single node in the queue, which is the Huffman 
 tree.
 
 4. Implement the `traverse` method in the `Branch` and `Leaf` classes. This method populates a map of characters and 
 their Huffman codes from a Huffman tree. In the branch class this method should call itself recursively on the left and 
 right children of the branch. The recursive calls to `traverse` each take a reference to the map and a new (different) 
    list. You need to add `false` to the list passed to the method call on the left-hand child, and `true` to the list 
    passed to the right. These lists of booleans represent the path being taken. It is essential that the lists passed 
    to the recursive calls are *deep copies* of the original list, not references (or aliases) to the same list -- 
    otherwise changes to either list will show up in all copies. The easiest way to make a deep copy is by using the 
    constructor of `ArrayList` that takes a list as an argument. For example:
 
    ```
    // make a deep copy of the list and add false to it
    ArrayList<Boolean> leftList = new ArrayList(list);
    leftList.add(false);
    ```
 
     In the `Leaf` class the method should store the pair of the character (the label of the leaf) and the list of 
     booleans (the path to that leaf) in the map.
     
 5. Implement the `buildCode` method in the `Huffman` class. This method constructs the map of characters and codes 
 from a tree. Just pass the empty code map to the `traverse` method of the tree along with an empty list, then return 
 the populated code map. 
 
 6. Now you have everything you need to complete the `encode` method in the `Huffman` class. Create the Huffman coding 
 for an input string by calling the various methods written above. I.e. create the frequency table, use that to create 
 the Huffman tree then extract the code map of characters and their codes from the tree. Then to encode the input data, 
 loop through the input string looking up each character in the map and add the code for that character to a list 
    representing the data. Return the code and the data as an instance of the `HuffmanCoding` class.
 
 7. The final steps are about decoding data which has previously been encoded. The first step in this is to take a map
 of characters and their Huffman codes and use it to reconstruct a Huffman tree. Implement the `treeFromCode` method in
 the `Huffman` class. Only the structure of the reconstructed 
 tree is required and frequency labels of all nodes can be set to zero. 
 
     Your tree will start as a single Branch node with null children. Make a local 
     variable referring to the root of this tree.
                           
     Then for each character key, `c`, in the code take the list of booleans, `bs`, corresponding to `c`. For every 
     boolean, `b`, in `bs`, if `b` is `false` you want to "go 
     left" in the tree, otherwise "go right".
                           
     Presume `b` is false, so you want to go left. So long as you are not at the end of the code (i.e. `b` is not the
     last element in `bs`) you just want to set the local variable that points to the 
     current node to be the left-hand child of the node you are currently on, but you may need
     to create that child first. So, if that child does not yet exist (i.e. 
     it is null) you need to add a new branch node there. Then carry on with the next entry in `bs`, again
     following the left or right-hand path as necessary.
                           
     If you have reached the end of this code (i.e. `b` is the final element in `bs`), add a leaf node labelled by `c` 
    as the left-hand child of the current node (right-hand if `b` is true). Then take the next char from the code and 
    repeat the process, starting again at the root of the tree.
     
 8. Finally, implement the `decode` method in the `Huffman` class. First, reconstruct the tree using the `treeFromCode`
 method. Then take one boolean at a time from the data and use it to traverse the tree by going left for `false`, right 
 for `true`. Every time you reach a leaf you have decoded a single character (the label of the leaf). Add it to the 
 result and return to the root of the tree.
